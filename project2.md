## **Project Workflow** 🚀

### **1. Data Connection and Import** 🔗
- Connected to multiple raw data sources in CSV and Excel formats.
- Utilized Power BI's **Power Query Editor** to load data seamlessly.
- Reviewed and documented the schema and metadata for all input data.

### **2. Data Transformation** 🔄
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - 🧹 Removed duplicates and null values.
  - 🏷️ Standardized column names and ensured consistency in formats (e.g., dates, currencies).
- **Data Merging and Shaping**:
  - 🔗 Merged datasets to integrate multiple sources into a unified view.
  - ✏️ Created custom columns for derived metrics such as profitability and growth rates.
- **Data Profiling**:
  - 🔍 Analyzed column distributions to identify potential outliers or anomalies.
  - ✅ Ensured data formatting and readiness for modeling.

### **3. Data Modeling** 🗂️
- **Schema Design**:
  - 🛠️ Designed a relational star schema with:
    - Fact table: Metrics like revenue, cost, and orders.
    - Dimension tables: Attributes such as products, customers, regions, and dates.
- **Relationships**:
  - 🤝 Established primary and foreign key relationships with correct cardinality.
  - 🔄 Enabled bidirectional filtering where required for detailed analysis.
- **Hierarchy Development**:
  - 📂 Built hierarchies for drill-down functionality (e.g., Year > Quarter > Month).

### **4. KPI Development** 📐
- Modeled key business metrics using **Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)**:
  - **📊 Total Revenue**: Aggregating revenue across transactions.
  - **💸 Profit Margin**: `(Revenue - Cost) / Revenue`.
  - **🔁 Customer Retention Rate**: Percentage of returning customers.
  - **📉 Order Conversion Rate**: Sessions-to-order ratio.
  - **📆 Year-over-Year Growth**: Comparing metrics over time periods.
- Developed calculated columns for:
  - 👥 Customer segmentation based on lifetime value.
  - 🎯 Product performance categorization (e.g., high-performing vs. low-performing).

### **5. Dashboard Design** 🎨
- **Dashboard Layout**:
  - 🖥️ Designed a clean and intuitive interface with separate sections for:
